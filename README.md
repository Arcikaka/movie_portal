### Movie Portal Project

##### Movie Portal with admin page for more customization

[========]

Hi, this is my final project for Coderslab PHP Course written in Symfony. 

After hitting /admin/ you can enter to administration panel, where you can write and edit your news/reviews and you can manage your movie base. It's very easy to add new Movies, Actors, Writers etc. 

Normal view for users is showing them your news/reviews etc. They can also comments your work and rate movies in your own database. 

User profile works with fos_user_bundle. 

All twigs are written in simple html to show that everything works. 

### `Installation`
To install just create fork and download repository to your pc. 
Use command 
~~~~
bin/console composer install
~~~~
Remember to create with doctrine a database and to update schema. Remember to create user with admin authorization. 

After that this simple web is ready to use.
