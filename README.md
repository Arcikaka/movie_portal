### Movie Portal Project

##### Movie Portal with admin page for more customization

[========]

Hi, this is my final project for Coderslab PHP Course written in Symfony. 

After hitting /admin/ you can enter to administration panel, where you can write and edit your news/reviews etc, and you can manage your movie base. 

Normal view for users is showing them your news/reviews etc. They can also comments your work and rate movies in your own database. 

User profile works with fos_user_bundle. 

All twigs are written in simple html to show that everything works.
